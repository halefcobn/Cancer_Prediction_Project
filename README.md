# Cancer_Prediction_Project
The project to create a machine learning model to predict the whether cancer is benign or malignant.

# DATASET

1. The dataset was taken from the Kaggle.
2. The dataset is about the cancer (benign or malignant)
   
# PREPROCESSING
In this step, I implemented standardization, normalization, boxplot for outliers and lastly feature selection to create a more accurate model.

# MODEL SELECTION
Our target is to find out whether someone has benign or malignant cancer.
Therefore;

Malignant (M) will be 1(negative result)
Benign (B) will be 0 (positive result)

# FINALLY 
A value of 100 was used here because it was desired to train the model with a lower error and show less tolerance.
We used SVM for the classification problem and has an AUC Score: 0.9682568149210904
